# Odin-recipes
My website containing several recipes. By finishing this project, i will have a hands-on
experience on how to build a website with HTML, combining every topic i learned so far
as correct and safe writing, putting links, putting tags that are necessary for the user 
interaction.

As my first project, i find it really educational and entertaining.
